# ZombieMario
A game based on Jmonkeyengine and Groovy.
The code has minimal dependancies on JME, it generates some vertices and textures them, so it can be used for other renderers available in Java or LWJGL directly.
Saving map components uses Groovy, not Groovy syntax directly but Groovy scripting capability.
WARNING: As default all generated maps by Groovy are actually java code. This can be dangrous for code injecting inside maps.
DO NOT DISTRIBUTE MAPS, THIS IS FOR TEST ONLY.
This project used JmonkeyengineSDK 3.0.
The game is for Desktop use, for mobile development SWING menus and map making parts must be omitted. Follow JME instructions for Android development.
